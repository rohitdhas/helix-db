# Helix DB 🌀

Helix DB is a simple NoSQL database written in TypeScript for Node.js. It uses a JSON file as its data store, making it easy to set up and use.

## Features

- Simple and easy-to-use API
- Supports basic CRUD operations (create, read, update, delete)
- Stores data in a JSON file
- Uses UUIDs as document IDs for uniqueness
- Lightweight and minimalistic, with no external dependencies

## Installation

You can install Helix DB using npm:

```
npm install helix-db
```

## Getting Started

To use Helix DB in your Node.js project, you can import the `helix-db` module and start using its API:

```typescript
import db from "helix-db";

// Create a new document
const doc = db.create({ name: "John Doe", age: 42 });

// Read a document by ID
const retrievedDoc = db.getById(doc.id);

// Update a document
db.update(doc.id, { age: 43 });

// Delete a document
db.delete(doc.id);
```

You can also retrieve all documents from the database using the `getAll` method:

```typescript
const allDocs = db.getAll();
```

You can erase the database using `erase` method:

```typescript
// 🚧 this will erase all data
db.erase();
```


## Limitations

Helix DB is designed to be a simple and lightweight database for small to medium-sized applications. As such, it has some limitations:

- Helix DB is not suitable for very large datasets, as all documents are loaded into memory when the database is initialized.
- The maximum size of the database is limited to 5 MB by default. This can be changed by providing a maxSize option in the Database constructor. If the database size exceeds the configured limit, an error will be thrown.
